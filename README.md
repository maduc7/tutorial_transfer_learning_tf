# Tutorial on using Transfer Learning in histopathology
The aim of this tutorial is to classify patches of colorectal tissues in 9 different classes using transfer learning.

We will run 3 experiments in parallel in order to better understand the topic:
- Using transfer learning & retraining all layers
- Using transfer learning & freezing half of the layers
- Training from scratch (= no transfer learning)

## Tutorial
The tutorial is implemented in tensorflow 2.0 in a jupyter notebook: `transfer_learning_classification.ipynb`

## Prerequisites
- [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (tested with: 3.7)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) (tested with: 2.0)
